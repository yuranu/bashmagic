Personal bash configuration I share between my computers

## 13-08-202
So after years of running this, I decided to reorganize it all a bit.
Bash scripts are organized in modules system.
Added some kind of an installation system.
Some featured removed, will gradually reintroduce them.
The old version is frozen on tag v0.1, from this point it will be discontinued.
